# Topic Ideas

- [x] **Introduction** - Why am I blogging?  What do I mean by each of the 3 areas?  (Perhaps split into 2?)


## Software Development

### Code

- [ ] **JS isn't that bad** - story of how I came to not mind JS :)
- **My projects**
    - [ ] **This Blog**
    - [ ] **MapMaker**
    - [ ] **DiffView**

### Tools

- [ ] **Atom**
- [ ] **ST3 & plugins**
- [ ] **VS Code** - try it out
- [ ] **Node for CLI app**
- [ ] **zsh**
- [ ] **dotfiles**
- [ ] **tmux**
- [ ] **keyboard keys** - F1, CAPS, Insert
- [ ] **asciinema.org** - also integrate with the site using [this plugin](https://github.com/narongdejsrn/hexo-tag-asciinema)
- [ ] **Use VCS** - Useful beyond just code; so worth learning even if you don't write software for a living

## Developing as a Developer

### Skills

- [ ] _DRAFT_ **Write your own tools**
- [ ] **I can't code** - look at what blocks people when they're trying to get into coding, and what techniques might help.
- [ ] **Learn by doing** - a look at some of the ways you can try out new coding languages/environments etc.
    - [ ] [CodeWars](www.codewars.com)
    - [ ] [TopCoder?](www.codewars.com)

### Goals/challenges etc.

- [ ] **Setting goals** - why you'd want to do it, what kinds of goals might be good, how you might track those goals (advertise them, beeminder, habitica etc.)
- [ ] **Do One Thing**

### Productivity

- [ ] **Pomodoro**
- [ ] **Kanbanflow**


## Developing Developers

- [ ] **Do One thing** (again - mentioned above already)
- [ ] **Jon is Evil** - or preferably my alternate RPG-style thinking.  Need ways to actually _use_ it though, not just build the picture.
