# About Me

* I'm a professional software developer
	* Mostly I write C though, so...
* I also enjoy having a pet project or two.  Current time-wasters are:
	* This
	* Learning Korean (for a trip in Autumn 2016)
	* Fixing up some [ESP8266][esp8266] in my flat (probably just doing some real-time data for starters)

# Why This?

* I wanted to have a play with [Jekyll][Jekyll] and [GitHub pages][gh-pages]
* There are some things I'd like to keep a record of, for posterity (more on that later)
* Writing can probably be fun, and will force me to take some of my pet projects a bit more seriously (and maybe even finish one)
