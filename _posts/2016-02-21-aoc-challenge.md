In my initial post for this blog, I insinuated that strange challenges might be afoot.  Well, I've set myself the challenge of trying all the [AOC cheeses][wiki_aoc_cheese].

As of February 2016, there are 48 AOC cheeses on the list - mostly French but a couple are Swiss.  I think it should be easy enough to get to 30, and possibly reasonably close to completion, but I expect for the final few we'll have to do some hunting, perhaps planning holidays with cheese in mind (that would make a change; normally I plan with local booze in mind).

So, I'll try to write a quick post for each cheese I tick off the list, and overall progress will always be available [here](/cheese).
