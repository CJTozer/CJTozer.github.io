Morbier is the first cheese in the AOC challenge, and honestly it was the cheese that inspired me to undertake the challenge itself.

It's a cheese that we've enjoyed before (bought from a small Spa while on a walking holiday in Austria IIRC), but I came across it last week in Borough Market and couldn't resist.  The market stall actually had two varieties of Morbier, one less aged (only 60 days?), and the other a fully matured 180 day-old.  I tried both, and naturally opted for the older one!

Morbier is produced in the Franche-Comté region of France (right by the Swiss border), and has a slightly interesting story for its appearance.  Traditionally, it was effectively made with the leftovers from making Comté - one half of the cheese was made with the left-over evening milk, then it was topped-up the next morning.  The distinctive dark stripe in the middle of Morbier is actually a layer of ash used to cover the evening layer overnight.

While some Morbier can be quite mild, the aged version pictured was anything but placid, trying pretty hard to remove the skin from the roof of your mouth, but also with a nuttiness akin to Comté itself.  Until I looked into it, I had assumed that the ash layer was in fact mould, and we were eating a cheese that had acquired some pungent blue flavours.

Pictured is the full feast, which was some delicious mushroom pâté (also from Borough Market, and oh so highly recommended), and another Franche-Comté cheese - "Val de Lou".

This second cheese, despite its appearance, and the fact that it is washed with local Jura wine is in fact a deliciously mild and creamy counterpoint to the more aggressive aged Morbier.  We enjoyed this (Valentine's day!) lunch with a glass of white - a nice crisp marsanne-viognier from Pays d'Oc (though I suppose Jura would have been more appropriate).  Dry white wine to cut through equally the pungent and the creamy.  Perfect!
