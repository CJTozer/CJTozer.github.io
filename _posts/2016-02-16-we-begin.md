Welcome!  First let me briefly introduce myself...

* I'm a professional software developer
	* Mostly I write C though, so...
* I also enjoy having a pet project or two.  Current time-wasters are:
	* This
	* Learning Korean (for a trip in Autumn 2016)
	* Fixing up some [ESP8266][esp8266] in my flat (probably just doing some real-time data for starters)
* Other hobbies include, but are far from limited to:
	* Cooking (and eating the food produced of course)
	* Video games (mainly [StarCraft 2][sc2] and [Path of Exile][poe])
    * Exploring the world
    * Watching sport, when I can find the time (NFL, cricket, rugby union, basketball, plus almost anything non-mainstream)
    * Exotic booze
    * Science

So, why this?

* I wanted to have a play with [Jekyll][Jekyll] and [GitHub pages][gh-pages]
* There are some things I'd like to keep a record of, for posterity (more on that later)
* Writing can probably be fun, and will force me to take some of my pet projects a bit more seriously (and maybe even finish one)

What am I going to talk about?

* Nothing, and everything.  Whatever takes my fancy.
* Likely some of the subjects mentioned in this post.
* I'm not really expecting anyone to read this, right now it's almost entirely for my own benefit.  Though I don't quite know what that benefit is yet.  Typing practice?
