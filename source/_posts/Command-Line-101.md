description: A quick introduction to the command line - why it's important and what it can do
---

Learning the command line is an extremely important skill for many occupations - especially for a developer.  Many tools are command-line only, some things are impossible (or nearly impossible) to achieve without using the command line - even when there is a graphical application that allows some of the same operations.

# Tutorial

Now, in this blog I don't intend to reinvent the wheel - if there's a good tutorial out there, I'll just point you at it.

So this is just a short post, and without further ado I think the [command-line tutorial](https://www.learnenough.com/command-line-tutorial) over at *Learn Enough* looks pretty good.  By looking through that tutorial, you should learn about:

* The basics of how commands work on the command line
* Find out more about commands using `man` pages
* Creating, modifying and inspecting files and directories

## On Windows

Note that the above tutorial is focussed on Linux (or MacOS, which is relatively similar).  Windows command line is quite different (and generally less well-used, less fully-featured, and less well-documented).

On Windows I would recommend setting up [Bash on Ubuntu on Windows](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/commandline/wsl/about) (a feature in Windows 10 which gives you a Linux command-line on top of Windows) - then when you've learned the basics of using Linux, you'll find it much easier to search on the web for answers of how to do the same things on Windows.

# Punch Line

* The command line is a really useful tool - and especially if you're serious about writing code you should take the time to get comfortable with it
* Let us know in the comments what your favourite command-line tool is, or let us know what the main challenge you've had to solve using the command-line is
