# Welcome to my Blog

## A Little about Me

I've been a software developer for 10 years now.  I've learned a lot, and got plenty of things wrong along the way.

For my day job I work on high-performance, high-availability telephony systems.  In my spare time I'm a hobbyist with a plethora of half-finished projects.

I'm a geek.  I love food, anime, (some) e-sports, (some) real sports, learning languages (지금 한국을 배워요) and travel.

I'm passionate about training software developers.

## My Blog Goals

This is my (second) attempt to start a regular blog.  I've not got on well with the idea of blogging before - and looking back I think that's at least in part because I wasn't clear with myself why I'm doing it.

So, this time I'm setting my goals out clearly up-front.

* Become a better software developer through the process of thinking about my blog posts, and of putting my thoughts to paper
* Produce content that has potential value to others
* Engage with the wider software development community, beyond my day job

Some things that aren't goals for this blog:

* Building a legion of loyal followers
* Making mega-bucks
* Always being right

## What's this Blog About?

There are 3 main topics I intend to focus on in this blog (though I'll probably digress at times).  These are:

* Software development
* Developing as a developer
* Developing developers

### Software Development

When I talk about blogging on "Software Development", I mean talking about the low level mechanics of doing your job as a developer.

I'm not generally going to try to teach how to program in a specific language (there are many excellent resources out there already), but instead I expect the emphasis to be on:

* Tools of the trade (from IDEs to low-level libraries)
* Tips & tricks
* Interesting projects (likely open source)
* Reviews/discussions of resources I've found

### Developing as a Developer

By reaching out to read other developers' blogs, you're obviously making some effort to learn.

Articles in this category will be aimed at helping you discuss and discover better ways to improve faster.  I'll talk about:

* Getting over the beginner's hump (and becoming a proficient coder in the first place)
* Ways to sharpen existing skills
* Where to look for inspiration, or when you are looking for a new challenge

### Developing Developers

Articles under this heading will likely have some overlap with the previous one, but here the emphasis will be on those of us who have a role in developing our colleagues into excellent developers.

This may be mentoring a new recruit, leading an inexperienced team, or just trying to get even more out of your top-performers.

I don't expect to have any magic bullets here, but I do feel strongly that this is an extremely important (and often overlooked) part of being involved in an organisation that does software engineering.

## You, the Reader
