## About Me

I've been a software developer for 10 years now.  I've learned a lot, and got plenty of things wrong along the way.

For my day job I work on high-performance, high-availability telephony systems.  In my spare time I'm a hobbyist with a plethora of half-finished projects.

I'm a geek.  I love food, anime, (some) e-sports, (some) real sports, learning languages (지금 란국을 배워요) and travel.

I'm passionate about training software developers.

## My Blog Goals

This is my (second) attempt to start a regular blog.  I've not got on well with the idea of blogging before - and looking back I think that's at least in part because I wasn't clear with myself why I'm doing it.

So, this time I'm setting my goals out clearly up-front.

* Become a better software developer through the process of thinking about my blog posts, and of putting my thoughts to paper
* Produce content that has potential value to others
* Engage with the wider software development community, beyond my day job

Some things that aren't goals for this blog:

* Building a legion of loyal followers
* Making mega-bucks
* Always being right
