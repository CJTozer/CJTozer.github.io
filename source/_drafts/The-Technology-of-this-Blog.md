This post aims to shed some light on how a blog is put together.  If you're already an experienced software developer, this will probably be very easy for you to find out for yourself (in fact you'll find many 100s of alternatives too), but for everyone, here's a quick run-down of the technologies involved.

Starting from the beginning, the process looks something like this:

* I write the article in Markdown format
* I use a tool called Hexo to turn this into an HTML blog
* Then I deploy these pages to my personal GitHub account
* Finally, I use DNS to set up my own personal domain to point at the GitHub pages

# Writing the Content

* Write Markdown files (link to this one on GH branch)
* I use Atom, since I'm also tweaking/fixing the theme code - but also mention MarkDownPad 2...
* Under Git version control, committing frequently because I'm paranoid...

# Blog Generation

* I use Hexo
    * Full process for creating this post (`hexo new deraft "The Technology of this Blog"` so far...)
* Theme
* Generates _static_ webpages (i.e. no back-end database to interact with; pages are not generated by the server on demand)

# Personal Domain

* Google Domains, etc. - pay annually

# Linking it all Together

* Cloudflare (DNS)
