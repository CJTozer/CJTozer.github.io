# Using this page

# Feature tests

See [here](https://hexo.io/plugins/) for a large list of plugins.

## Code blocks

Example of a reasonably-sized, syntax-highlighted code block in the middle of some paragraph text.

``` python
"""Some syntax-highglighted python."""
class AClass(object):
  """Class for no good reason."""
  def do_the_things(foo):
    """Ronseal"""
    bar = zorblax(foo)
    bar.crustacean()
    return bar.event_horizon
```

Should look reasonable, and still feel like the text is flowing around the code.

## Images

Here's an embedded image ![](/images/ElbaSea.png) with text around it.  So it fills the whole column, and text just wraps exactly as it's written.

## Emojis :heart: Hexo

See the list [here](http://www.webpagefx.com/tools/emoji-cheat-sheet/).

* They work :smile:...
* But not in the TOC...
