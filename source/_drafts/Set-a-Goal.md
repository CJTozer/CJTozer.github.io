I'm going to begin this post with a little bit about my story.  I - like a lot of people I know - spent quite a number of my formative years not setting myself any clear goals.  This involved a combination of drifting through, and having goals imposed on you from the outside.

This was true through school, university, and quite a while at the start of my career.  If there's one thing I'd like you to take away from this post it's this:

> You can set your own goals

Go on - try it!

It can be anything.  And I really mean that - if you're aiming for something specific, it doesn't have to be dramatic or meaningful; you can still get a great feeling of progress, and some extra motivation, by setting yourself a clear goal and working towards it.

If you're a manager or a mentor, then you should absolutely be doing all you can to encourage your team to set their own goals.

# Some Thoughts on Goals

* Be as specific as possible - and make sure you have a clear way to measure progress
* Goals are much more likely to be successful if they're set by the person trying to achieve them, not forced upon them
* For most goals, just telling someone else you have these goals is a strong motivator
* It's about the process.  Achieving your goal is not the be-all and end-all - be careful to remember the progress you make along the way and give yourself credit for that

# Tracking goals

Once you've decided on your goals and told people that you're aiming for them, there are a couple of interesting ways to track them:

## Beeminder

[Beeminder](https://www.beeminder.com/) is a strange concept at first - they let you track your goals, with the added feature that if you fall behind, they fine you.  I was initially skeptical, but it's perfectly possible to use their site without risking a penny - and even then I find it very motivating^[In fact right now the only reason I'm writing this post is because my week is up to write this next post and Beeminder is hassling me...].

Beeminder is great for ongoing tasks (like write a blog post per week) and also has special modes aimed at weight loss/gain.

I have a Beeminder account set up, and I'm currently tracking the following goals:
* Write a blog post at least once every 7 days for this site :page_facing_up:
* 7 Korean study sessions per week :kr:
* At least 3 teetotal days per week :beers:
* 100 press-ups per week :muscle:

So far (and this blog target nearly got me as I write this post), I've managed to keep up with all of these (and have done much better than I would have without this extra tracking/accountability).

I'm about to add another target, which is 10 minutes of stretching each day.  I'm super-inflexible! :stuck_out_tongue:

## Habitica

[Habitica](https://habitica.com/) adds a role-playing slant to all this, where you gain experience, gold and items when you successfully complete tasks, and lose HP when you miss your targets.

Habitica is good (as the name implies) for trying to form habits (like drinking less, or exercising more) - but also for giving you an extra feeling of reward when you check off items on your "to do" list.

# Final Thoughts

* What goals have you set yourself?
* How do you track your goals?
* What motivates you most to achieve those goals?
