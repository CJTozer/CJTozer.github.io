# Getting Started

Learning to write code can be daunting.  I know some people who claim they would
love to be able to write code (and I believe they're telling the truth), but
have never quite found it possible to get started.

Normally I've found that this comes down to two things:
* Not knowing where to start
* Not having a _need_ that forces them into it

The second of these is simpler on the face of it - if there's no _need_ to
learn, chances are the motivation is harder to get.

Not knowing where to start is probably getting harder not easier these days -
there's no shortage of really excellent tutorials, guides and books out there.
But which one do you pick?  And what if you choose the wrong one?

# What Language to Choose?

@@@ There's no wrong answer
@@@ Remember that the aim is to learn.  If you try using C to write a website,
or blah for doing blah, you might well find it's incredibly hard - but you'll be
learning all the way - and nothing's stopping you changing your mind (@@@ give
my examples?)

# Key points

* Getting into code can be a problem of motivation (not intellect) - so pick a problem you really want solving
* Computers are excellent at predictable, repetitive tasks - so make the most of it!
* Set a challenge?
* Readers let me know if there's a case-study you'd like me to work through on the blog
